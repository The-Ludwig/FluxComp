A numpy/pandas compatible python package to calculate Cosmic Ray flux models.

This was born out of the [PANAMA](https://github.com/The-Ludwig/PANAMA) python package.

## Installation

```bash
pip install FluxComp
```

## Name

In the German dub of Back to the Future, the Flux Capacitor is translated as the 'Flux Compensator'.
We use cosmic ray flux models to compensate the unphysically distributed simulation fluxes to refer to
a physical model.

<!-- ## Installation -->

<!-- ```bash -->
<!-- pip install fluxcomp -->
<!-- ``` -->
